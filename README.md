# Healthcare-Diabetes Prediction

In this project, my aim is interpreting different models used to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The analysis aimed to evaluate the quality of the data and determine the important independent variables useful for predicting the target variable. The study involved performing data cleaning, feature selection, and evaluation of numeric variable distributions to identify missing data. The analysis also included selecting useful independent variables using different methods, evaluating their independence, and identifying the impact of outliers. AutoML libraries like H2O.ai were used to create predictive models, and SHAP analysis was performed to interpret the models. The SHAP analysis is used to interpret the models and compare them with other interpretability methods. The objective is to gain insights into the models and their predictive power in the context of the Diabetes dataset. The study provided valuable insights into the importance of data cleaning, feature selection, and predictive learning techniques, highlighting the significance of selecting useful independent variables and handling missing data. The research presents a comprehensive understanding of data analysis techniques and their applications in predictive learning.
